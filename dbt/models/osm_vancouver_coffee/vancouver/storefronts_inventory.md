{% docs storefronts_inventory %}

An annual inventory of the City of Vancouverâ€™s ground-level storefronts
(commercial retail spaces) and shopping malls.

## Note
The 2020 Spring baseline for this data was collected over a long period owing to
resource constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  While most of the
baseline data was collected from March to May in 2020, some areas were
inventoried as early as January 2020, and others were inventoried through the
summer.  Thus, the period between the 2020 baseline and the 2021 update varies
from 9 to 15 months.

## Data currency
The inventory is conducted annually in the springtime (March/April) and this
dataset is refreshed in June.

## Data accuracy
The addresses for each commercial retail unit (CRU) are mapped to the centre of
the property parcels connected to that address.  On larger parcels, multiple
CRUs are mapped to the same location. Thus, spatially the data is accurate to
the block, and there are instances (e.g. in downtown and Yaletown), where CRUs
from parallel streets are mapped to the same point location.
